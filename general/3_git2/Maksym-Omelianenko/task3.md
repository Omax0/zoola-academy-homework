# Task 3: Use your imagination

Description: for this task I've did some search and found a bit of usefull and easy to use things.
First trick is about improving `git log` command look. If we'll try to use
`git log --graph --oneline --decorate`, our log looks prettier and more readable.

Other trick is so simple command `git checkout -` that let you to come back to the previous branch,
which was checked. I really didn't know about it and just typing name of branch again and again,
but this command very helped me.

And the last trick is stashing uncommitted changes using `git stash`. This command hides change
that you don't want to commit (for example unfinished feature) and give us clear working tree
and let us to switch to another branch. Then we can use `git stash pop` if we need to return the changes
or we can use `git stash drop` if we want to clear stash stack.

Conclusions: these commands are usefull and easy to use. It helps to improve your workflow.
